        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8">
          A verbal pattern recognition drill for people preparing for coding interviews — no IDE, no typing, just thinking out loud.
        </p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">LeetCode tests whether you can implement. This tests whether you understand.</h2>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
            A verbal walkthrough takes roughly half the time of a full implementation — no debugging, no test cases, no environment to set up. Lower commitment means you can fit a problem into a lunch break or a commute instead of blocking out an hour at a desk.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            leetgame isn't a replacement for LeetCode. It's a complement — useful when you're preparing for an interview and want to drill recall and articulation, and just as useful for staying sharp after, when you want to keep the patterns fresh without the overhead of a full coding session.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">The gap interviews expose</h2>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Most people can recognize a solution when they see it. Fewer can explain <em>why</em> sliding window applies, <em>why</em> the complexity is O(n), <em>why</em> a greedy approach is correct. That gap is what interviews probe — and what most practice methods don't address.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            leetgame drills pattern recognition and articulation in isolation — see the problem, name the pattern, explain why it fits, walk through the algorithm. An AI evaluates your reasoning and pushes back when it's incomplete. Explaining something clearly forces you to actually understand it, and that understanding is exactly what interviewers are looking for.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Practice should fit into your life</h2>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
            A coding environment needs a laptop, a quiet space, and a chunk of uninterrupted time. That's a high bar. Most days the conditions are never quite right, so you don't practice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            leetgame works on your phone, takes a few minutes per problem, and fits into dead time — a commute, a lunch break, five minutes between meetings. Lower friction means you actually practice instead of waiting for the perfect conditions that never come.
